/**
 * Topic: Operators
 *
 * Summary:
 * - Operators are used to perform operations on values (operands)
 * - Common operator types:
 *   - Arithmetic (+, -, *, /)
 *   - Comparison (==, ===, >, <)
 *   - Logical (&&, ||, !)
 *   - Assignment (=, +=, -=)
 */

// Example
let a = 10;
let b = 15;

let c = a + b; // + is arithmetic, = is assignment
console.log(c); // 25

/**
 * Interview notes:
 * - === checks both value and type
 * - && and || are commonly used in conditions
 */
